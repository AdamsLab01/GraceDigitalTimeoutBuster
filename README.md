Grace Digital Timeout Buster 

This sketch was written to work with the Grace Digital GDI-IRBM20 streaming radio. The purpose of this sketch and the accompanying hardware is to cycle through selected presets on the GD player to bypass the inactivity timer of the streaming service. 

The GD player supports various streaming services but I've only tested with the Sirius service.
